This library should be used by Sailfish applications to create a QML view.
libsailfishapp will take care of using the booster if possible, and will
also make sure that applications built with the Sailfish SDK are future-
proof, by putting all special cases inside libsailfishapp, where it can be
updated by the vendor.

Usage:

  1. In the .spec file, add:

        BuildRequires: pkgconfig(sailfishapp)

  2. In the .pro file, add:

        CONFIG += sailfishapp

  3. In the .desktop file, use:
  
        Exec=sailfish-app-launch <appname>
